In Array,
    Insertion of element in middle took = O(n)
        - because of copying elements to next array location after insertion.

In linked list
    -   Insert element at beginning = O(1)
    -   Delete element at beginning = O(1)
    -   Insert/Delete element at end = O(n)
    -   Linked list traversal = O(n)
    -   Accessing element by value = O(n)

    Two benefits over an array
        -   You don't need to pre-allocate space
        -   Insertion is easier

Doubly linked list
    -   having 2 reference, 1 for prev and 1 for next.
