In tree there should be only one path between two nodes

Directed Graph
    -   There is a direction in the way two nodes are connected.
    Ex: Flight routes between two cities
    -   every node is giving direction to other node.
Undirected Graph
    -   There is no direction to how two nodes in the graph are connected.
    Ex: Facebook connections

Weighted Graph
    -   every direct graph having weight on their edges.
